    <h2>Your nature painting helps the enviroment!</h2>
    <p>I believe that nature should be respected, admired, and cared for. 
    That's why commissioning Gergana's nature paintings help better our planet.
    Gergana donates 10% of every commission to a non-profit organization to fight climate 
    change.
