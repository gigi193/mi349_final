    <h2>Nice to meet you, I'm Gergana!</h2>
    <img src="IMG_4740.JPG" width="300" alt="Gergana">
    <p>It has always been my passion to create art that captures beautiful moments 
        in nature. I have taken art lessons ever since 1st grade and continued to improvise 
        and create art. I find joy in recreating nature pictures because I love the beauty
        of nature. <br>
        My passion sparked the idea of bringing one's favorite memories in nature. This 
        was my calling to bring the small moments to life. I want to bring joy in people's 
        lives and show how beautiful nature is. <br>
        I have a mission to help restore the environment that we live in. That is why 
        your paintings fight climate change by having to choose a non-profit organization
        to donate 10% of your order. Not only will you have a cherished memory to hang up,
        you will be proud to have helped save our environment.   </p>
